```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Wave plot


```{r cars}
x <- seq(0, 20, by = 0.01)
y <- sin(x)
sin_df=data.frame(x,y)



```
$$
\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1
\\
 A=\left(\begin{matrix} a_{11} & a_{12}\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{matrix}\right). \]
$$
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(sin_df$x, sin_df$y, type = "l", xlab = "x", ylab = "sin(x)", main = "Plot of sin(x)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
